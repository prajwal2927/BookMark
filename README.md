📌 BookMark — Your Personal Bookmark Manager

BookMark is a modern web application that helps users save, organize, and manage their favorite links in one place. Instead of losing important resources across browsers and notes, BookMark provides a clean and secure platform to store bookmarks and access them anytime.

The application is built with a focus on simplicity, usability, and performance. Users can easily add, view, and manage bookmarks through an intuitive interface. Authentication ensures that bookmarks remain private and personalized for each user.
